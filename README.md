#Project Overview

PunchIT is a digital loyalty program designed to help retail stores implement a modern, hassle-free rewards system. We have seen that studies show 83% of customers enrolled in a loyalty program return to a store at least once, proving that a well-structured rewards system is key to customer retention.
Traditional paper stamp cards are outdated. They get lost, forgotten, and do not have the ability to keep customers engaged. In today’s digital world, customer retention and direct engagement are more important than ever. Without features like push notifications and real-time updates, physical stamp cards can’t keep up.
