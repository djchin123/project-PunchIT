## Project Overview

PunchIT is a digital loyalty program designed to help retail stores implement a modern, hassle-free rewards system. We have seen that studies show 83% of customers enrolled in a loyalty program return to a store at least once, proving that a well-structured rewards system is key to customer retention.
Traditional paper stamp cards are outdated. They get lost, forgotten, and do not have the ability to keep customers engaged. In today’s digital world, customer retention and direct engagement are more important than ever. Without features like push notifications and real-time updates, physical stamp cards can’t keep up.

What we offer:
Businesses can create their own unique loyalty cards, tailored to their brand and customer base.
Customers can collect virtual stamps with each purchase, track their progress, and easily redeem rewards at their favorite stores.
In the end, our mission is to help local businesses. We want to give these small businesses a tool to compete with big brands through our loyalty program. By modernizing this type of rewards program, we can ensure local shops that we love in Amherst, Boston, and beyond, will stay competitive, one punch at a time.
